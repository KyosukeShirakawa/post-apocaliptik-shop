I declare that this solution is my own work. I have not copied or used solutions from third parties. I have not shared my solution with other students, nor have I made it publicly available. I have not used code or code fragments generated by artificial intelligence. According to Section 377/A of ELTE’s Academic and Examination Regulations (HKR), if I use unauthorized tools or provide unauthorized help to another student, I will not be able to complete the course.
